Getting data from the server.

    Each time the user clicks on an anchor tag with an href = value
to switch to a new page, the browser makes a connection to the
web server and issues a 'GET' request to GET the content of the 
page at the specified URL.
 
 
    The server returns the HTML document to the browser, which
formats and displays the document to the user.
