# HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)


The dominant Application Layer Protocol on the internet.

Invented for the Web - to retrieve HTML, Images, Documents, etc.

Extended to handle data in addition to document - RSS, Web Services,
etc.

Basic Concept: Make a connection - Request a document
- Retrieve the document - Close the connection.

Internet and sockets were created in the 1970's, HTTP was invented
in 1990 and is an application protocol that runs atop sockets. 
  




# Uniform Resource Locator (URL)


    http://  | data.pr4e.org  | /page1.htm
   protocol  |     host       |  document





# Internet Standards

The standards for all of the internet protocols (inner workings)
are developed by an organization.

Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

www.ietf.org

Standards are called 'RFCs' - 'Requests for Comments'.




# Making an HTTP Request

Connect to the server like data.pr4e.org - a 'handshake'

Request a document:

    GET http://data.pr4.org/page1.htm HTTP/1.0
    GET http://www.mlive.com/ann-arbor/ HTTP/1.0
    GET http://www.facebook.com HTTP/1.0

    (
        Install telnet, and in command line, and the host (data.pr4e.org)
    and the port (80)

    Type any of the above requests including 'GET' and 'HTTP/1.0'
    and leave an empty line after.

    When done it presents a header which includes the status line
    'HTTP/1.1 200 OK' or '404 Not Found' as well as the content type
    at the bottom. 'Content-Type: text/html' and leaves a blank line
    after the header to indicate the header (meta data) has been completed
    before it provides the data.

NB: Network Sockets are like phone calls for pairs of applications.
